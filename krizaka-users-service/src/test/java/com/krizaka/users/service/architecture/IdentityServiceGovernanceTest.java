/**
 * Governance for krizaka-users-service — for now, only the rule that could not be left out.
 *
 * <p>This service had no governance suite at all (the M0.5 inventory records it). It is created
 * here for [CFG-001] alone: the identity library's configuration types and this service's own are
 * bound only in this process, so no other suite's classpath reaches them. The rest of the rules
 * every other service runs — SEAM-002, ERR-103, ERR-129, ERR-130 — are still absent, and still
 * recorded as absent; adding them is not this change.
